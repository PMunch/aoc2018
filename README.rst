Advent of Code 2018
====

Welcome to my repository of solutions for AoC in Nim. The plan is to upload new
solutions the day after the puzzle is released (no cheating!), but no
guarantees I actually make it through them all.

The solutions found here all read "input.txt" from their folder. So to run it
on your own input simply save them to the folder of the right day.

All solutions will be written in Nim, and with nothing but the standard
library. I will also try to keep the code as simple and Nim-like as possible.
This means that performane is not one of the primary objectives.
